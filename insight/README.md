# Overview 
Writing clean code is hard work. Writing clear text about clean code is equally challenging. The goal of this project is to simplify this process by analysing a prospective blog post against the analytical metrics of the top 10% of most popular blog posts (determined by number of claps) for the top 5 most prolific blogs under the Medium umbrella:
1. Towards Data Science
2. Hacker Noon
3. Becoming Human: Artificial Intelligence Magazine
4. Chatbots Life
5. Chatbots Magazine

# Data Availability
The main data set contains scraped posts from Medium-affiliated plots tagged with AI, Machine Learning, Datascience, or Artificial Intelligence from September 2017 - September 2018. It was put together by Aiswarya Ramachandran and is available on Kaggle:
