<title> DraftingBoard: A tool for optimizing blog posts </title>

<p> Writing clean code is hard, but writing clean text about clean code can be even more challenging. This tool is designed to take a look at the content of the first draft of a blog post which contains both text and code and offer suggestions about what to be improved to make it more accessible. For both authors and website hosts, this offers benefits in terms of higher readership, engagement, and advertising revenue.</p> 

<p> Here's a sample code snippet for analysis.
<code>
import pandas as pd 

for line in self.lines:
# Reset tracking variables
line_code = 0
line_comment = 0

# If the comment character is not present, assume line of code
if line.find(commentchar) == -1:
	 line_code = 1
# If a comment character is present, determine where it falls to see if line is a pure comment, or mixed code + comment
else:
	 comment_start = line.index(commentchar)
	 if comment_start == 0:
		 line_code = 0
		 line_comment = 1
</code>
